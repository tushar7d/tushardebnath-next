So Last year we started migrating to a brand new design system and as you all can imagine the process of migrating an existing product to a new design system is a long and involved process.
There are a few ways you can do it.

You could either build your product from scratch using the new design system or you could choose to evolve your existing product by incrementally migrating to the new design system.
We choose to do the latter. since building a product like ours from scratch would just not be feasible.

The problem was that doing so would mean translating the existing product as is into the new design system as a first step.
Now, this first step of 1:1 conversion may seem like an easy task (and it is in terms of execution), but the thing is, it comes with some major cons.
It is a slow and tedious task.

It takes away time which you can otherwise be used for things more important than just changing the design language.
It is repetitive & prone to human errors.

The solution was simple we could automate it.

I created a Figma plugin which would take any existing design and replace the styles with the closest matching styles in the new design system.
Like in the video below the colours are matched with the colours defined in the Design system and the closest match is applied as a style.
