I have a background in engineering and I have allways been passionate about using technology to design better. I have over the years developed multiple tools in the form of Fontend Toolkits, Sketch/Figma Plugins to help designers design better. 

### Design Systems

I am experienced in setting up process & workflow for building & maintaining Design systems. I have done so for multiple organisations and in varying capacities. 
I have also worked closely with implementation teams and understand the technical nuances of implmenting token and component based systems. 

I am as of now developing my own Opensource brand agnostic design system for everyone .
