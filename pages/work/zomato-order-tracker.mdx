# Zomato Order Tracker

Helping millions of Zomato users answer the biggest question of all time! "Mera Khana Kahan hai?"( Where is my Food ? )

<Item original={"/zomato/crystal.png"} width={`800`} height={`600`}>
  {({ ref, open }) => (
    <img src={"/zomato/crystal.png"} ref={ref} onClick={open} />
  )}
</Item>



## Context & My Role

Zomato is India's largest food delivery platform, with millions of users ordering food every day. As a Senior Product Designer, I led the redesign of their existing order tracking system and created a framework for scalability, rapid development, and testing.

## Problem

Based on user studies and internal tracking matrices, we formulated a series of problems we wanted to resolve with this re-design:

- Reducing user anxiety about the status of their order.
- Help users build trust in the system.
- Create a scalable design framework for all our different businesses like food delivery Grocery Delivery, Nutrition (Health Supplement) Etc.

## A brief walkthrough of the solutions

### Reducing user anxiety about the status of their order.

For reducing user anxiety, we tried two approaches. A/B testing and user interviews helped us decide on a winning approach. The following is a brief overview of the two approaches that we used.


<Item original={"/zomato/one.png"} width={`670`} height={`910`}>
  {({ ref, open }) => (
    <img src={"/zomato/one.png"} ref={ref} onClick={open} />
  )}
</Item>


#### Approach 1 (Winner)

In this approach, we used bold colours and typography to suggest the status of the order, by using existing colours associations (for instance, green is perceived as positive).

<Item original={"/zomato/two.png"} width={`670`} height={`910`}>
  {({ ref, open }) => (
    <img src={"/zomato/two.png"} ref={ref} onClick={open} />
  )}
</Item>


#### Approach 2

In this approach, we used progressive disclosure to call out the precise state that the order is in. So the user knows on a micro-level what is happening with their order. This approach did not work out for us as it was negatively impacting our matrices like ORS (orders equiring support) and Order cancellation.

### Help users build trust in the system.

We believe that transparency is essential when it comes to building
trust, so we are very committed to being as open as we can regarding
the status of the order. We ensured that all stakeholders responsible
for delivering our food to our users communicate their status on an
individual basis, so the user will always know exactly where their
order stands. Below are a few examples from the Delivery Partner and
Restaurant communication

#### Delivery Partner Communication

<Item original={"/zomato/4.png"} width={`1606`} height={`418`}>
  {({ ref, open }) => (
    <img src={"/zomato/4.png"} ref={ref} onClick={open} />
  )}
</Item>

#### Restaurant Communication
<Item original={"/zomato/5.png"} width={`1440`} height={`322`}>
  {({ ref, open }) => (
    <img src={"/zomato/5.png"} ref={ref} onClick={open} />
  )}
</Item>


### Creating a modular system for scalability

All the designs have been created with modularity and scalability in
mind and have been scaled to all of our LOBs
