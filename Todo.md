Hello, I am Tushar, I build digital products, custom design tools,
workflows and design systems. For 8 years I've worked with teams
applying human-centred design to challenges in Travel, Hyper Local, and Personal Communication.

 A bit about me, I Love building digital products, design tools,
          workflows and design systems. Currently, I work at Zomato as senior
          product designer. When I am not designing or coding, you can find me
          reading fantasy books, working on my podcast, or travelling with my
          wife.
