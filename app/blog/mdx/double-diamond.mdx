# Double Diamond
The Double Diamond is a model for the design process that has become widely popular in the design industry. It was developed by the British Design Council and is a visual representation of the iterative and divergent-convergent process that designers often use to solve complex problems. The model consists of four stages: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver.

## Discover
This stage involves exploring the problem space and gaining an understanding of the needs, wants, and motivations of the users. This stage is characterized by divergent thinking, where a wide range of possibilities are considered. This stage is about understanding the problem, gathering information, and researching the user base. It involves conducting user research, stakeholder interviews, and market analysis to better understand the problem space. This information is then used to create a clear problem statement that outlines the design challenge.

## Define
In this stage, the focus shifts to narrowing down the scope of the problem and defining the design challenge. This stage is characterized by convergent thinking, where the team takes the information gathered in the discovery stage and uses it to create a clear definition of the problem and the design challenge. The goal of this stage is to create a shared understanding of the problem, the stakeholders, and the design requirements.

## Develop
This stage is where the design team begins to generate potential solutions. The goal is to create multiple concepts and prototypes that explore different design solutions. This stage is characterized by divergent thinking, as the team creates many different ideas and approaches. This stage is about testing and prototyping, with the team exploring different design solutions, testing them with users, and refining them based on feedback.

## Deliver
The final stage is about delivering the final solution. This stage is characterized by convergent thinking, as the team focuses on refining and finalizing the best solution. The team will work on finalizing the design, testing it with users, and making any necessary changes based on feedback. Once the design is finalized, it is delivered to the stakeholders and the team moves on to the next project.

In conclusion, the Double Diamond model is a useful tool for designers, as it provides a clear and structured approach to solving complex design problems. The model helps designers to think critically and systematically about the problem, understand the users, generate multiple design solutions, and refine the best solution. By using the Double Diamond model, designers can ensure that they are making informed design decisions, and that they are delivering effective and user-centered solutions.
